It works because it cost more to create new blocks than are being added. Plus you have to have over 50% of the nodes 

The ease with which someone can alter the blockchain depends on the proportion of the network that they own. It’s possible to calculate the probability of someone being able to alter the blockchain depending on the proportion of the compute power that they control and the number of blocks back in the chain they are trying to amend.

For example, someone who controlled 20% of the compute power of the network has a 40% chance of being able to change the last block in the chain, but only a 4% chance of being able to change a block that is 5 blocks back in the chain. Someone who controls 10% of the compute power of the network has a less than 0.1% chance of being able to change a block 6 blocks back in the chain.
> 
> This last calculation is the basis for deciding when a transaction is confirmed: even if someone managed to capture 10% of the compute power of the network, they’d still have less than a 0.1% chance of altering a block that is 6 blocks deep in the chain. It’s judged unlikely that anyone would capture that much of the network, and they’re still unlikely to succeed even if they did, so 6 blocks feels like a safe bar for transactions in the Bitcoin network to need to meet.
