# check-mate Plan

- Needs to be built into workflow
- Like a firefox plugin


Find a simple use case

1) Linux packages
2) Software development libraries (e.g. maven)
3) Point and click download
4) Supply chain 

Lets pick 3)

- Normally checksum is for integrity and signature is for authenticity of origin

- e.g. rpm repos already do this.

- Take the certificate transparency model

- Assume are going to build a plugin for firefox

- Could plugin annotate the web page? could be tricky

Task Breakdown:

- Sourcing data
- Shove into a "block chain" using a tool like ethereum
- Some kind of client tool
